synax documentation
===================

Welcome to synax's documentation!

**Synax** is a Python package designed to simulate Galactic synchrotron emission, covering both total and polarized intensity. **Synax** leverages the capabilities of [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html/), providing features like automatic differentiation (AD) and support for multiple platforms (CPU, GPU, TPU, etc.). With access to gradients, **Synax** can seamlessly integrate into the broader **JAX** ecosystem, enabling the use of efficient inference algorithms such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and ADAM optimization.

   Haslam 408 MHz map can be reproduced by optimizing a 3D grid **B** field with **synax**!

.. admonition:: Where to start?
    :class: tip

    üñ• A good place to get started is with the :doc:`source/installation` and then the
    :doc:`nb/Simulation_lsa` guide. 

    üí° Then :doc:`nb/Integration` and :doc:`nb/Fields` shows more details on how we generate the necessary variables.

    üìñ We demonstrate some examples about what can we do with AD in :doc:`nb/Sampling_lsa` and .

    üêõ If you find bugs, please head on over to the GitHub issues page.
