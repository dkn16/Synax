Synax documentation
===================

Welcome to Synax's documentation!

`synax` is a python package to simulate Galactic sychrotron emission, for both intensity and polarized intensity. 
`synax` is heavily based on `jax <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html/>`_ to obtain the features such as automatic differentiation (AD) and multi-platform (CPU, GPU, TPU, etc. ) support.
With the access to the gradient, one can integrate `synax` with the whole `jax` ecosystem easily, and perform efficient inferecen algorithms such as Hamitonian Monte Carlo and ADAM optimization.

   Haslam 408 MHz map can be reproduced by optimizing a 3D grid **B** field with `synax`!

.. admonition:: Where to start?
    :class: tip

    üñ• A good place to get started is with the :doc:`source/installation` and then the
    :doc:`nb/Simulation_lsa` guide. 

    üí° Then :doc:`nb/Integration` and :doc:`nb/Fields` shows more details on how we generate the necessary variables.

    üìñ We demonstrate some examples about what can we do with AD in :doc:`nb/Sampling_lsa` and .

    üêõ If you find bugs, please head on over to the GitHub issues page.
