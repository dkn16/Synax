synax documentation
===================

Welcome to **synax**'s documentation!

**synax** is a Python package designed to simulate Galactic synchrotron emission, covering both total and polarized intensity. **synax** leverages the capabilities of `JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, providing features like automatic differentiation (AD) and support for multiple platforms (CPU, GPU, TPU, etc.). With access to gradients, **Synax** can seamlessly integrate into the broader **JAX** ecosystem, enabling the use of efficient inference algorithms such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and ADAM optimization.

   Haslam 408 MHz map can be reproduced by optimizing a 3D grid **B** field with **synax**!

**synax** intensity is currently designed for frequencies above ~ 408 MHz as it does not include free-free emission and absorption which is prominent in lower frequencies. This feature will be added in upcoming versions.

For polarizations, **synax** is recommended to use with frequencies higher than 1 Ghz as lower frequencies requires fine integration step size to resolve the change in polarization angle changes along sightlines. This would exceed the typical memory limit of GPUs.

.. admonition:: Where to start?
    :class: tip

    üñ• A good place to get started is with the :doc:`source/installation` and then the
    :doc:`nb/Simulation_lsa` guide. 

    üí° Then :doc:`nb/Integration` and :doc:`nb/Fields` shows more details on how we generate the necessary variables.

    üìñ We demonstrate some examples about what can we do with AD in :doc:`nb/Sampling_lsa` and optimising :doc:`nb/Optimising_haslam`.

    üêõ If you find bugs, please head on over to the GitHub issues page.
